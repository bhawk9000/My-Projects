# My-Projects

1. The Forrest - A FPS horror game that allows the player to interact with objects via
   a Leap 3D camera. The game is written in Unity3D in C#. The player uses a Leap-Motion 
   3D space camera to control the movement in the game. The player can even use the Leap-Motion 
   device to pick up objects and use them to interact with the game.

2. Flocking Algorithm - These are the scripts that I wrote in order to allow objects 
   to fly through the air in a flock. Using these scripts allows games to have bird A.I. that 
   fly realistically. The scripts were written in C# and used in Unity3D.

3. Water Physics - This script contains an algorithm that allows a material to 
   respond to forces acted upon it, simulating water movement. This was written in C# and
   used in Unity3D.

4. Online Game - This is the source code to my Game Design final project which is a 3rd
   person shooter that can be played online. It can either be played with LAN or by hosting
   an online match. This was written in C# and used in Unity3D.

5. Solr Settings - This consists of the managed-schema and solrconfig files that I modified
   in order to scrape eBay listings and index them to a search engine I created using 
   Apache Solr.

6. Chess Enemy A.I. - This consists of the Minimax.java script written that allows the 
   computer player to make decisions using the Minimax algorithm. This was added to an already
   created chess game. Written in Java.

7. Rational Number Calculator - Complete calculator written in C++.
